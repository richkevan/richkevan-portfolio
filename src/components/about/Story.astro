          <p>I got my start in programming with an old Apple IIC that was given to us by a family friend. From there I went on to build web pages, modify Wordpress, and customize Myspace profiles. The early exposure to the Apple IIC and my subsequent adventures in web design and customization ignited a lifelong passion for programming and problem-solving, which continues to drive my career in the world of technology and software development.</p>

          <p>I learned to create my first websites in notepad and dreamweaver.  It was a time when the internet was still in its infancy, and the thrill of designing and coding my own web pages was a unique blend of creativity and technical mastery. Those early days of web development laid the foundation for my ongoing passion for technology and design, as I continue to explore the ever-evolving landscape of web development and digital creativity. </p>
